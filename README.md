# Mark's MAC Converter:

### GETTING STARTED
It is extrememly important to format your CSV/XLSX version of your Maintenance Allocation Chart (MAC) according to the example MAC in the templates folder named "*MARK MAC ATTEMPT.xlsx*". The program will **NOT** parse through your MAC and give you a properly formatted MAC in XML format if you do not do so. Once you launch the executable named '*MAC Converter*', click '*Select File*' and located your CSV/XLSX version of your MAC. A messagebox will show up to verify the path of your MAC input file. Next, click on '*Generate XML*' to export a properly XML-formatted MAC in the location of your choice.
