# Mark's MAC Converter:

### GETTING STARTED
It is extrememly important to format your CSV/XLSX version of your MAC according to the example MAC in this folder named "*MARK MAC ATTEMPT.xlsx*". The program will **NOT** parse through your MAC and give you a properly formatted/completed MAC in XML format if you do not do so. Once you launch the executable named '*MAC Converter*', click '*Select File*' and located your CSV/XLSX version of your MAC. A messagebox will show up to verify the path of your MAC input file. Next, click on '*Generate XML*' to export a properly formatted MAC in XML. 

### GETTING YOUR MAC OUTPUT
Your final converted MAC XML output will be saved in the '*dist*' folder that holds the executable you clicked on to run the program. The name of the file output is '*TEST MAC.xml*'. You can rename that file to whatever you need once exported fully. If you have any questions about how to use this program feel free to bother **Mark** or **Nick R**. They will be happy to help you get going.
